Glyph Splash Page 
==========================

This simple page, intended to add email addresses of those interested to the 
Glyph MailChimp email list, is built using Ruby on Rails, MailChimp API, and Twitter
Bootstrap CSS framework. It's important to note, however, that Ruby on Rails was simply
used as an easy way to build the view and controller and virtually none of the traditional uses of Rails
(Active Record, for instance) are being used.


Getting Started
==========================

1. Run bundle install to install the necessary gems

    % bundle install

2. Add an environment variable for ENV['MAILCHIMP_API_KEY']

3. Start Rails server:

    % rails s
